# DTE-S2GOS Observation Simulator

The **S2GOS Observation Simulator** produces physically-based synthetic observations
for satellite, UAV, and ground-based Earth observation sensors. It is the simulation
component of the DTE-S2GOS service.

## What it does

Simulations are configured as a single `SimulationConfig` object and executed by a
backend using the 3D radiative transfer model [Eradiate](https://eradiate.eu). Given a scene (generated by the S2GOS Scene Generator) the simulator can produce:

- **Satellite imagery** Emulating real instruments (Sentinel-2's MSI) or custom instrument)
- **Ground baser measurements** RGB, Radiancemeters, ...
- **Level 2 prducts** HDRF, HCRF, FAPAR, ... 

Spectral coverage spans 250-3100 nm, at resolutions of up to 0.1 nm

## Getting started

See [Setup](setup.md) to install the package and run your first simulation, browse
the [API Reference](api/simulation.md) for the full configuration schema.
